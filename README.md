Kidney Exchange Game: A Resource Allocation and TTC Core Allocation Implementation

Overview

This repository provides an implementation of a kidney exchange game, a complex combinatorial optimization problem where incompatible kidney donor-patient pairs exchange kidneys to maximize the number of successful transplants. The implementation focuses on resource allocation and Top Trading Cycles (TTC) core allocation mechanisms.

Key Features

Resource Allocation:
Efficiently allocates kidneys to maximize the number of transplants.
Considers various constraints, such as blood type compatibility and geographical limitations.
TTC Core Allocation:
Implements the TTC core allocation mechanism to ensure fairness and stability.
Guarantees that no group of agents can improve their outcomes through pairwise exchanges.
Flexible Framework:
Accommodates different kidney exchange scenarios and problem sizes.
Adaptable to various optimization algorithms and techniques.
Clear Code Structure:
Well-organized code with clear comments and explanations.
Modular design for easy understanding and modification.
